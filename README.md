# Netflix-Streaming-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s streaming content dataset. The analysis aims to uncover valuable insights regarding the structure, trends, and patterns in the Netflix content catalog.

The dataset includes information such as

* Titles of Netflix content
* Content type (Movie or TV Show)
* Directors and Cast members
* Country of release
* Release Year
* Date Added to Netflix
* Content ratings
* Duration and genres

The analysis includes multiple steps such as data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation using Python and its data science libraries.

Key analysis sections

* Data cleaning and preprocessing which includes handling missing values, parsing dates, normalizing text columns
* Univariate analysis covering content type distribution, ratings count, genre frequency, release year patterns
* Multivariate analysis covering relationships like release year versus content type, or duration versus genre
* Country-wise content analysis identifying top countries contributing content to Netflix’s library
* Duration analysis identifying typical lengths of movies and TV shows
* Trends over time highlighting the growth of Netflix’s library across years
* Visual storytelling through interactive and static plots

Key Libraries Used

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib


Project Objectives

* Perform end-to-end data analysis on a real-world streaming dataset
* Apply data cleaning and feature engineering techniques
* Extract actionable insights and visualize patterns
* Showcase data storytelling for portfolio, learning, or interview preparation
